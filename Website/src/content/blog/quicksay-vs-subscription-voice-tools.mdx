Voice-to-text tools have converged on subscription pricing. Wispr Flow charges $144/year ($12/month billed annually). Aqua Voice charges $96/year ($8/month). The assumption is that voice typing is a service you rent, not a tool you buy.

We disagree. Here's why one-time pricing makes more sense for voice-to-text software, and what it actually costs to use these tools over time.

## The 3-Year Cost Comparison

Let's do the straightforward math on what you'd pay over three years with each tool:

| Tool | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | **3-Year Total** |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **QuickSay** | $39 | $0 | $0 | **$39** |
| Aqua Voice | $96 | $96 | $96 | **$288** |
| Wispr Flow | $144 | $144 | $144 | **$432** |

Over three years, Wispr Flow costs nearly 11x what QuickSay costs. Aqua Voice costs about 7x. The gap only widens with time, because subscriptions compound and one-time purchases don't.

By year five, you'd have paid $720 for Wispr Flow. QuickSay is still $39.

## Why Subscriptions Became the Default

Subscription pricing benefits the vendor, not the customer. Recurring revenue is more predictable, more valuable to investors, and produces higher lifetime customer value. There are legitimate reasons for subscriptions when a product has ongoing server costs, continuous feature development, or per-user resource consumption.

But voice-to-text doesn't inherently require a subscription model. The core transcription API costs are small (Groq offers 8 hours of free daily transcription), the desktop app runs locally, and the fundamental technology doesn't change month to month. You don't need a new version of "voice to text" every 30 days.

## What You Get for $39 (Launch Pricing)

QuickSay includes everything you need for voice-to-text dictation on Windows:

- **Groq Whisper transcription** — fast, accurate speech-to-text in 25 languages
- **AI text cleanup** — removes filler words, adds punctuation, formats naturally
- **Works in every Windows app** — VS Code, Word, Slack, browsers, terminals
- **Voice commands** — control formatting, punctuation, and text actions by voice
- **Custom dictionary** — teach it your terminology, names, and technical jargon
- **8 hours free daily** — via Groq's free tier, included at no extra cost

There's no premium tier. No feature gating. No "upgrade to Pro for unlimited transcription." The $39 purchase (launch pricing, regular $74) includes everything.

## The Hidden Cost of Bloat

Cost isn't just about money. It's also about what a tool demands from your system.

QuickSay's install size is about 105 MB with no background services or bundled AI models. A smaller footprint means less disk space used, less RAM consumed, and fewer background processes competing for your system's attention.

For developers and power users who are already running VS Code, Docker, a browser with 40 tabs, and a Slack instance, every megabyte of RAM matters. A leaner tool that stays out of the way is worth more than a bloated one packed with features you don't use.

## Privacy Costs Something Too

Some subscription voice tools offer optional screen capture features to add context to transcriptions. When enabled, these features read what's on your display — your code, your messages, your documents, your browser tabs.

QuickSay doesn't capture your screen. Zero screen capture, zero telemetry. The only data that leaves your machine is the audio clip you're transcribing, and that goes directly to Groq's API for processing. We don't retain any data on our servers — Groq handles the audio per their own [privacy policy](https://groq.com/privacy-policy/).

Privacy shouldn't be a premium feature. It should be the default.

## One-Time Pricing Is Making a Comeback

The subscription fatigue is real. People are paying monthly for their music, their storage, their note-taking app, their email, their VPN, their password manager, their design tool, and their AI assistant. Each individual subscription seems reasonable. In aggregate, they add up to hundreds of dollars per month.

We're seeing a shift back toward one-time purchases for tools that don't need ongoing costs. Developers in particular are gravitating toward software they can buy once, own, and run without worrying about renewals.

QuickSay is built on that principle. Pay once, own it, use it as long as you want. If voice-to-text is something you use daily, $39 is a fair deal. If it's something you use occasionally, $39 still makes more sense than committing to a subscription.

## Making the Switch

If you're currently paying for a subscription voice-to-text tool, the math is simple: at $8/month for Aqua Voice, QuickSay's $39 price pays for itself in about 5 months. At $12/month for Wispr Flow, it pays for itself in just over 3 months. After that, every month is pure savings.

And if you've never tried voice typing before, $39 is a low-risk way to find out if it works for you. No trial period to remember to cancel. No credit card on file that gets charged when you forget.
