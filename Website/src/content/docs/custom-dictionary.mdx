## Why Use a Custom Dictionary?

Speech-to-text engines sometimes misinterpret uncommon words: brand names, technical terms, acronyms, or proper nouns. QuickSay's custom dictionary tells the AI exactly how these words should appear in your text.

For example, without a dictionary entry, "quicksay" might be transcribed as "quick say" or "quick-say." A dictionary entry ensures it always appears as "QuickSay."

## Adding Dictionary Entries

1. Open QuickSay settings from the system tray.
2. Navigate to the **Custom Dictionary** section.
3. Add entries in the format shown below.

Each entry maps a spoken form to the desired written form:

```json
{
  "quicksay": "QuickSay",
  "groq": "Groq",
  "api": "API",
  "oauth": "OAuth",
  "postgresql": "PostgreSQL"
}
```

  style="border-radius: 8px; margin: 2rem 0; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"
/>

## Dictionary File Location

The dictionary is stored as a JSON file in your QuickSay data directory:

```
%APPDATA%\QuickSay\dictionary.json
```

You can edit this file directly with any text editor. Changes take effect on the next dictation — no restart required.

## How the Dictionary Affects AI Cleanup

During the text cleanup step, The AI receives your dictionary entries as context. When it encounters a word matching a dictionary key, it substitutes the preferred form. This happens after transcription, so it corrects both Whisper errors and formatting.

## Tips

- **Case matters for output.** The value you set is exactly what appears in your text.
- **Acronyms work well.** Add entries like `"aws": "AWS"` or `"ci cd": "CI/CD"`.
- **Proper nouns are the biggest win.** People's names, product names, and company names are the most common misinterpretation by speech-to-text.
- **Keep the list focused.** A dictionary with 50-100 targeted entries performs better than one with thousands of generic words.
