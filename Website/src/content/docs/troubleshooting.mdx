## QuickSay Isn't Typing in My App

**Symptom:** You dictate, the overlay shows success, but no text appears.

**Cause:** QuickSay inserts text via the clipboard. Some applications block clipboard access or don't respond to paste commands in certain contexts.

**Solutions:**
- Make sure the target text field is focused (click on it) before dictating.
- Try a different application to confirm QuickSay is working. Notepad is a reliable test.
- Some elevated (admin) applications block clipboard access from non-admin processes. Try running QuickSay as administrator.
- If the app uses a custom text input (e.g., some Electron apps), try pressing `Ctrl+V` manually after dictating.

## Audio Quality Is Poor

**Symptom:** Transcriptions are inaccurate or missing words.

**Solutions:**
- Check your microphone in **Windows Settings > Sound > Input**. Ensure the correct device is selected and the input level is adequate.
- Move closer to the microphone or reduce background noise.
- In QuickSay settings, try switching the **Recording Quality** preset. Higher quality captures more detail but produces larger files.
- External USB microphones generally outperform built-in laptop mics.
- Avoid Bluetooth microphones if possible — they often use a lower-quality audio codec.

## Groq API Errors

**Symptom:** QuickSay shows an API error after dictating.

**Common causes and fixes:**

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid or missing API key | Check your API key in QuickSay settings |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Free tier rate limit exceeded | Wait a few minutes, or upgrade your Groq plan |
| `500 / 503` | Groq server issue | Check [Groq status](https://status.groq.com) and try again later |

The Groq free tier allows approximately 8 hours of transcription per day. If you consistently hit limits, consider a paid plan or spreading usage across the day.

## High Latency

**Symptom:** There's a long delay between speaking and text appearing.

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection. QuickSay requires a stable connection to Groq's API.
- Large audio clips take longer to process. Keep individual recordings under 30 seconds for best performance.
- Groq servers occasionally experience higher load. Check [Groq status](https://status.groq.com).
- If you're on a VPN, try disconnecting — VPNs add latency to API calls.

## Text Appears Garbled or in the Wrong Language

**Symptom:** The transcribed text is nonsensical or in a language you didn't speak.

**Solutions:**
- If you have Auto-detect enabled, try setting your language explicitly in QuickSay settings.
- Ensure your microphone isn't picking up background conversations or audio from speakers.
- Low-quality audio can confuse language detection. See the audio quality section above.
- If the issue persists with a specific phrase, add it to your [custom dictionary](/docs/custom-dictionary).

## QuickSay Won't Start

**Symptom:** The application doesn't appear in the system tray after launch.

**Solutions:**
- Check if QuickSay is already running in the system tray (it may be in the overflow area — click the `^` arrow).
- Restart the application from the Start menu or installation directory.
- Check the QuickSay log file at `%APPDATA%\QuickSay\log.txt` for error details.
- Ensure your Windows version is 10 or later (64-bit).
