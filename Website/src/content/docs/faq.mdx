## Is my audio stored anywhere?

Your audio is sent to Groq's servers for transcription and is subject to [Groq's privacy policy](https://groq.com/privacy-policy). QuickSay itself does **not** store, upload, or retain your audio recordings after transcription completes. Audio files are deleted from your local machine after each session.

## Does QuickSay work offline?

No. QuickSay requires an internet connection to communicate with Groq's APIs. There is no offline mode. This is a deliberate trade-off: cloud-based processing delivers significantly better accuracy and speed than on-device alternatives.

## What's the difference between QuickSay and Windows Speech Recognition?

| | QuickSay | Windows Speech Recognition |
|---|---|---|
| **Speed** | Under 500ms round-trip | Variable, often slower |
| **Accuracy** | Groq Whisper + AI cleanup | On-device recognition |
| **Languages** | 25 languages | Limited set |
| **Training** | None required | Requires voice training |
| **Punctuation** | Automatic via AI | Manual or limited |
| **Custom dictionary** | Yes | Limited |
| **Voice commands** | Natural language | Rigid command syntax |

## Can I use my own connection key?

Yes. You can bring your own connection key if you already have a Groq account. Go to **Settings > AI Connection** and paste your Groq connection key. This is useful if you need higher rate limits or want to use a paid Groq plan.

## Is there a Mac or Linux version?

QuickSay is Windows-only. There is no confirmed timeline for Mac or Linux support.

## How much does QuickSay cost?

QuickSay is free during the open beta. No credit card required. After the beta, it will be a one-time purchase — no subscription, no recurring fees.

## What if the free tier changes?

You're not locked into any specific pricing tier. QuickSay lets you bring your own connection key, so if the free offering changes, you can switch to a paid plan or any compatible service endpoint.

## What data does QuickSay collect?

QuickSay collects **zero telemetry**. No usage data, no analytics, no crash reports are sent anywhere. The only network requests QuickSay makes are to Groq's API for transcription and cleanup.

## Can I change the keyboard shortcut?

Yes. Open QuickSay settings from the system tray and assign any key combination you prefer. The default is `Ctrl+Shift+Space`.

## Does QuickSay work with every application?

QuickSay inserts text via the clipboard, which works with the vast majority of Windows applications. A few apps with custom text inputs may require manual paste (`Ctrl+V`). See [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting) for details.

## How do I update QuickSay?

QuickSay checks for updates automatically. When an update is available, you'll see a notification in the system tray. Updates are free for life with your one-time purchase.
