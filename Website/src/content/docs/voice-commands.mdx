## How Voice Commands Work

Voice commands are processed by AI as part of the text cleanup step. You don't need to pause or use a special trigger word — just speak them naturally within your dictation and they'll be interpreted as actions rather than literal text.

For example, saying "Send the report to Sarah **new paragraph** Let me know if you have questions **period**" produces:

```
Send the report to Sarah.

Let me know if you have questions.
```

## Tips for Best Results

- **Speak naturally.** AI understands context, so you don't need to be robotic.
- **Combine commands with dictation.** "Meeting at 3pm comma conference room B period" works as expected.
- **Punctuation is also automatic.** Even without explicit commands, AI adds punctuation based on your speech patterns. The commands above give you manual control when needed.
