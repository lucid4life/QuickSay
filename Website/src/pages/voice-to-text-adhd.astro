    Ideas move fast. Typing is slow. QuickSay lets you speak your thoughts the moment they arrive — AI handles the cleanup.
  </Fragment>

  <p class="text-lg">
    For people with ADHD, there is often a gap between having an idea and getting it written down. Thoughts arrive quickly, overlap, and can disappear before you finish formulating the first sentence on a keyboard. Voice-to-text closes that gap. Speaking is faster than typing, requires less executive function to initiate, and captures ideas in real time. QuickSay adds a cleanup layer that makes the result usable without requiring you to go back and edit.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-headline font-semibold text-2xl text-text-primary pt-4">Messy Input, Clean Output</h2>
  <p>
    The challenge with ADHD and text input is not a lack of ideas — it is the overhead of organizing them into written form while simultaneously having the next three ideas. Traditional typing demands that you think, structure, type, correct, and format — all at once. Voice dictation lets you separate the thinking from the formatting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speak your thoughts as they come. They do not need to be perfectly structured or logically ordered. QuickSay's AI cleanup takes the raw output and produces clean, punctuated, readable text.
  </p>
  <div class="bg-surface border border-border rounded-xl p-5 my-4">
    <p class="text-text-tertiary text-sm font-mono mb-2">What you say:</p>
    <p class="text-text-secondary italic">"okay so the thing about the project is that we need to move the deadline because the API isnt ready and also I just realized we never updated the documentation from the last sprint and that's going to be a problem for onboarding the new developer who starts next week"</p>
    <p class="text-text-tertiary text-sm font-mono mt-4 mb-2">What QuickSay types:</p>
    <p class="text-text-primary">"We need to move the project deadline because the API isn't ready. Also, we never updated the documentation from the last sprint, which will be a problem for onboarding the new developer who starts next week."</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The spoken version is stream-of-consciousness. The cleaned version communicates the same points clearly. You captured the thought; QuickSay made it presentable.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-headline font-semibold text-2xl text-text-primary pt-4">Lower Activation Energy</h2>
  <p>
    Starting a task is often the hardest part with ADHD. Opening a document, positioning the cursor, and typing the first sentence can feel like an outsized barrier when your brain is already three steps ahead. QuickSay reduces that initiation to a single physical action: press and hold a key. You do not need to think about formatting, spelling, or structure. Just speak. The friction between "I should write this down" and actually writing it down drops to nearly zero.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-headline font-semibold text-2xl text-text-primary pt-4">Quick Capture Across Applications</h2>
  <p>
    People with ADHD often work across many applications simultaneously — a note app, a browser, a chat window, a project management tool. Thoughts relevant to different contexts arrive in unpredictable order. Because QuickSay works in every Windows application, you can capture a thought wherever you are. Click into the relevant app, speak, and move on. There is no need to remember to go back later, because the note is already there.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-headline font-semibold text-2xl text-text-primary pt-4">Email and Messages Without the Dread</h2>
  <p>
    Composing emails and messages can be disproportionately draining when you have ADHD. The combination of choosing the right words, maintaining professional tone, and finishing before losing focus makes a simple reply feel like a significant task. Voice dictation with cleanup bypasses most of this friction. Speak your intent conversationally, and AI handles the tone and structure. A reply that might have sat in your drafts folder for three days gets sent in 10 seconds.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-headline font-semibold text-2xl text-text-primary pt-4">No Setup Overhead</h2>
  <p>
    QuickSay requires no voice training, no calibration, and no profile setup. Install it, set your keyboard shortcut, and start speaking. AI transcription handles transcription from the first use with support for 25 languages. There is no configuration rabbit hole to fall into and no settings to optimize before you can be productive. It works out of the box, which matters when every extra step is a potential point of abandonment.
