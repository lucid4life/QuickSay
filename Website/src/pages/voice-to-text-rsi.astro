    Typing pain is real, and it compounds. QuickSay lets you dictate instead of type — reducing keystrokes to near-zero for text-heavy work.
  </Fragment>

  <p class="text-lg">
    If you deal with repetitive strain injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, or general hand and wrist pain from typing, you already know the frustration. The work does not stop because your hands hurt. Deadlines, messages, emails, and documentation all still need to happen. QuickSay provides a practical way to reduce your daily keystroke count by offloading text-heavy tasks to voice dictation.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-headline font-semibold text-2xl text-text-primary pt-4">Fewer Keystrokes, Less Strain</h2>
  <p>
    The math is straightforward. An average email is 75-150 words, or roughly 400-800 keystrokes including corrections. A Slack message is 20-50 words. A documentation paragraph is 100-200 words. Add these up across a workday and the total reaches tens of thousands of keystrokes — each one a small mechanical stress on tendons, nerves, and joints that may already be inflamed.
  </p>
  <p>
    QuickSay reduces the keystroke count for these tasks to near-zero. Hold a keyboard shortcut, speak, release. The text arrives cleaned and formatted. The only keystrokes involved are the keyboard shortcut press and a final Enter or Tab to confirm. For someone managing RSI, shifting even half of their daily text input to voice can be the difference between a painful workday and a manageable one.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-headline font-semibold text-2xl text-text-primary pt-4">Works in Every Application</h2>
  <p>
    RSI does not care which application you are using. The strain comes from the total volume of typing across your entire day — email, chat, documents, code comments, browser forms, search bars. QuickSay works in every Windows application because it operates at the system level. There is one tool to learn, one keyboard shortcut to remember, and it handles text input wherever you need it. You do not need separate dictation solutions for different apps.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-headline font-semibold text-2xl text-text-primary pt-4">Clean Output Without Editing</h2>
  <p>
    One of the challenges with basic dictation tools is that the raw transcription often needs manual editing — fixing punctuation, capitalizing sentences, removing filler words. That editing still requires keyboard use, which partially defeats the purpose. QuickSay's AI cleanup step handles this automatically. The text that arrives is properly capitalized, punctuated, and structured. For many messages and notes, you can send or save the result without touching the keyboard at all.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-headline font-semibold text-2xl text-text-primary pt-4">Complement to Ergonomic Changes</h2>
  <p>
    Voice typing is not a replacement for ergonomic keyboards, wrist rests, proper desk height, or medical treatment. It is an additional tool that addresses the root cause of repetitive strain: repetition. Ergonomic equipment reduces the stress per keystroke; voice typing reduces the number of keystrokes altogether. Used together, they provide more relief than either approach alone.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-headline font-semibold text-2xl text-text-primary pt-4">Quick to Start Using</h2>
  <p>
    QuickSay installs in minutes and requires no training period. There is no voice profile to build, no calibration session, and no learning curve for the software to recognize your speech patterns. AI transcription handles the transcription from the first use, supporting 25 languages with automatic detection. If your hands are hurting right now, you can be dictating within minutes of downloading.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-headline font-semibold text-2xl text-text-primary pt-4">Free During the Open Beta</h2>
  <p>
    QuickSay is free during the open beta. There is no monthly fee that adds financial stress to physical stress, and no subscription to cancel if your condition improves. The free AI tier currently provides generous daily transcription limits — enough to dictate through an entire workday without hitting a usage cap. For anyone dealing with typing-related pain, this is worth trying today.
