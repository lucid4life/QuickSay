        About QuickSay
      </h1>

      <div class="prose-about fade-in-up space-y-6">
        <h2>Why QuickSay exists</h2>
        <p>
          I got tired of paying $15/month to rent software. Not just the money — the principle. You pay forever, and the moment you stop, it's gone. For something I use every single day, that felt wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked at the alternatives. Wispr Flow: $180/year. Aqua Voice: $120/year. Good tools, but I'd be paying rent indefinitely for something that should just work. The free options were either inaccurate or came with privacy trade-offs I wasn't comfortable with — screen capture, telemetry, data collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I built QuickSay. You pay once. You own it. No telemetry, no screen capture, no subscription tax. That's the deal.
        </p>

        <h2>I use QuickSay to build QuickSay</h2>
        <p>
          About 95% of my day-to-day typing goes through QuickSay. Emails, documentation, code comments, commit messages, feature planning — I dictate most of it. When the transcription is off, I feel it immediately. When the AI cleanup gets punctuation wrong, I see it in my own work.
        </p>
        <p>
          That tight feedback loop made the product better, faster. When you use your own tool every day, you notice the rough edges. You fix them because they annoy <em>you</em>, not because a user filed a ticket.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also validated the core premise: voice typing isn't just for accessibility or dictating emails. It's legitimately faster for most writing tasks once you trust the transcription quality.
        </p>

        <h2>The pricing philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          QuickSay is free during the open beta. No credit card required. When the beta ends, it will be a one-time purchase — no subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here's the thing: QuickSay doesn't host the AI. You bring your own Groq API key. Groq's free tier gives you roughly 8 hours of transcription per day. If you somehow exceed that, their paid tier is a few dollars per month for unlimited. You pay Groq directly. No markup. No middleman tax.
        </p>
        <p>
          This keeps QuickSay's incentives aligned with yours. I'm not trying to maximize your usage to justify a subscription. I'm trying to build software that works well and stays out of your way. You pay once, I keep improving it, and we both benefit from Groq's competitive pricing.
        </p>
        <p>
          All updates are free. Check the <a href="/changelog">changelog</a> to see what's shipped. If you bought v1.0, you get v1.4, v2.0, and beyond at no extra cost.
        </p>

        <h2>What's next</h2>
        <p>
          I'm one person, so updates won't be daily. But I use QuickSay constantly, which means I'm constantly finding small improvements. Faster startup, better dictionary learning, smarter punctuation handling, tighter integrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="/changelog">changelog</a> is the source of truth. If something breaks or you have feedback, email me at <a href="mailto:say@quicksay.app">say@quicksay.app</a>. I read everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          QuickSay will stay a one-time purchase. No pivots, no "we're adding a Pro tier," no bait-and-switch. The business model is simple: build something people want, charge a fair price once, keep improving it.
