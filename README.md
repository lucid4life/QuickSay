# QuickSay

**Voice-to-text dictation for Windows.** Press a hotkey, speak, and your words appear as text wherever your cursor is.

QuickSay uses Groq's Whisper API for fast, accurate speech-to-text transcription with optional AI-powered text cleanup that adds punctuation, fixes grammar, and removes filler words.
